### The source codes

* We developed FastBioseq on top of the implementation of FastText, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec from the Genism python library (Rehurek and Sojka, 2010), and the implementation of ProtVec (Asgari and Mofrad, 2015). 
* We developed ProbeRating’s neural network using Tensorflow and Keras libraries (Abadi et al., 2015).
